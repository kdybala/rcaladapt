# rcaladapt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rcaladapt is to access climate data from Cal-Adapt.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rcaladapt from [Github](https://github.com/pointblue/rcaladapt) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pointblue/rcaladapt")
```
<!-- You can install the released version of rcaladapt from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("rcaladapt") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(rcaladapt) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
